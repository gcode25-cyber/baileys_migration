Thanks for sharing the full WebSocket connection log. Here's a quick diagnosis and set of clear **actionable fixes** based on your output:

---

## üîç What's Going Wrong?

You're trying to connect to:

```
wss://<your-replit-subdomain>:5000/ws
```

But **the connection fails with code `1006`**, which means:

> *‚ÄúConnection closed abnormally (no close frame received)‚Äù*

This typically happens when:

1. ‚úÖ WebSocket server **isn't running** on port `5000`
2. ‚ùå Port `5000` is **blocked** or **not exposed publicly** on Replit
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è You're trying to use `wss` without proper HTTPS setup or support
4. üß± TLS/SSL mismatch ‚Äî the backend might not support `wss` (secure WebSocket)

---

## ‚úÖ What to Fix

### 1. **üß† Replit Exposes Only Port 443 (HTTPS) or 80 (HTTP)**

Replit doesn‚Äôt allow public access to custom ports like `5000`. Everything routes through their proxy, usually on port `443` (for `https`/`wss`) or `80`.

üîß **Fix: Don't hardcode port 5000 in the frontend.**

**Change this:**

```ts
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://your-replit-url:5000/ws");
```

**To this:**

```ts
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://" + window.location.hostname + "/ws");
```

This way, it uses the correct domain **without** specifying a blocked port.

---

### 2. **üì§ Ensure Your Backend Listens on Correct Port**

Even if you use `localhost:5000` in dev, in Replit you must use the port they expose:

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

Replit sets the `PORT` env automatically, so **never hardcode `5000` on Replit**.

---

### 3. **üß™ Confirm Backend WebSocket Server is Actually Running**

Make sure you're calling `wssServer.handleUpgrade()` or equivalent on the same `server` instance.

If using `express` + `ws`:

```js
import express from "express";
import http from "http";
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws";

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server, path: "/ws" });

wss.on("connection", socket => {
  console.log("WebSocket connected");
  socket.send("Hello from server");
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server started on ${PORT}`));
```

---

### 4. **üîê Use `wss://` Only If HTTPS Is Available**

Replit supports HTTPS, so `wss://` is fine ‚Äî **as long as you don't include a port** like `:5000`.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Working Frontend Example (No `undefined`, No Port Issues)

```ts
const protocol = window.location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss" : "ws";
const host = window.location.hostname;
const ws = new WebSocket(`${protocol}://${host}/ws`);
```

This ensures:

* Correct protocol (ws/wss)
* No manual port number (Replit handles it internally)
* Works locally and on Replit

---

## üßº Clean-Up Tasks

* [ ] Remove any `:5000` port from client-side WebSocket URL
* [ ] Make sure server uses `process.env.PORT`
* [ ] Test WebSocket endpoint locally before deploying
* [ ] Use Replit Console: `curl https://your-app.replit.dev/ws` to confirm socket upgrade from inside the container

Let me know if you want me to audit the exact socket code, or write a boilerplate working on both **localhost** and **Replit**.
