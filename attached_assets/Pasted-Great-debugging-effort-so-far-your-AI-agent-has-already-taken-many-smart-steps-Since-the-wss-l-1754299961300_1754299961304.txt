Great debugging effort so far ‚Äî your AI agent has already taken many smart steps. Since the `wss://localhost:undefined/?token=...` issue still persists, here are **specific suggestions** to help your AI agent finish resolving the issue effectively:

---

## ‚úÖ Suggestions for AI Agent to Fully Resolve the WebSocket URL Issue

---

### 1. **Explicitly Define Port Instead of Using `window.location.port`**

When running on Vite default dev server, `window.location.port` may return an empty string because it uses port 5173, and browsers don't always expose it explicitly.

üîß **Suggestion**:
If you're building the WebSocket URL like this:

```ts
const port = window.location.port;
```

Replace it with a fallback:

```ts
const port = window.location.port || 5173; // fallback to Vite default
```

Or **better yet**, define a dedicated port via an `.env` file or config.

---

### 2. **Avoid Token Leakage from Old Scripts or Extensions**

Since `token=GLjAwx-nDgre` appears in the error even though you removed token usage, it may be:

* hardcoded in some other script,
* inserted via a browser extension,
* or injected during build from an old cache.

üîç **Suggestion**:

* Search codebase for `.token=` or `token=` in **all frontend AND backend** directories:

  ```bash
  grep -rnw './client' -e 'token='
  grep -rnw './server' -e 'token='
  ```

---

### 3. **Manually Sanitize the WebSocket URL Construction**

Make sure the final URL is printed/logged *just before* WebSocket is constructed.

üîß **Suggestion**:
Add this debug log:

```ts
const port = 5173;
const wsUrl = `ws://localhost:${port}`;
console.log("WebSocket URL:", wsUrl);
const socket = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
```

Then verify in console:
‚úÖ **URL is valid** (not undefined)
‚úÖ **No unexpected query params**
‚úÖ **Correct protocol (`ws://` vs `wss://`)**

---

### 4. **Check for Vite HMR (Hot Module Reload) Sockets**

Vite sets up its own internal WebSocket for hot module reload. This may appear as a WebSocket connection in the console.

üß† **Suggestion**:
Ignore or distinguish this internal Vite socket:

* URLs like `/@vite/client` are Vite's own sockets.
* Filter real-time app WebSocket errors from devtool logs using a unique path, e.g., `/ws-app`.

---

### 5. **Ensure Environment Variables Are Accessible in Frontend**

If your agent is reading env vars like `WS_PORT` in React or Vite, make sure they're prefixed with `VITE_`.

üîß **Suggestion**:
Use `.env`:

```env
VITE_WS_PORT=5000
```

Then access in code:

```ts
const port = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_PORT || 5173;
```

---

### 6. **Use Browser Network Tab to Confirm**

Inspect the actual request in DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WS tab. Look for:

* the **exact WebSocket request URL**,
* the **source of the request** (which script/file).

This helps narrow down if an old script or route is still initiating a connection.

---

### 7. **Check for Service Worker**

A service worker may be caching outdated scripts that still attempt to connect to old URLs.

üßº **Suggestion**:
In browser:

1. Go to `chrome://serviceworker-internals`
2. Unregister any relevant service workers
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

### 8. **Global Code Audit (Optional but Powerful)**

Do a full codebase search for `new WebSocket(` and audit every place a socket connection is made.

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus Suggestion: Centralize Socket Setup

Have a central file for initializing WebSocket (e.g., `src/utils/socket.ts`) to avoid duplicates, like:

```ts
const port = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_PORT || 5173;
const protocol = location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss' : 'ws';
export const socket = new WebSocket(`${protocol}://localhost:${port}`);
```

## ‚úÖ Final Check Summary for AI Agent

| Check                                          | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Ensure fallback for `window.location.port`     | üîÑ     |
| Remove leftover/cached token code              | üîÑ     |
| Add logging before socket creation             | ‚úÖ      |
| Verify actual WebSocket traffic in Network tab | ‚úÖ      |
| Unregister any service workers                 | üîÑ     |
| Search all instances of `new WebSocket`        | ‚úÖ      |
| Use `.env` with `VITE_` prefix in Vite         | üîÑ     |

---

If the agent follows these steps, the error should be resolved completely. Let me know if you'd like a sample `socket.ts` utility file as well.
