## System Architecture
The application is built with a React frontend (TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui) and a Node.js backend (Express, TypeScript). Data is managed using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. WhatsApp integration is handled via the `whatsapp-web.js` library, supporting QR code authentication, session persistence, and multiple WhatsApp accounts. Authentication is session-based. File storage utilizes the local file system with Multer.

**Core Features:**
- **Authentication:** User registration, login, and session management.
- **WhatsApp Integration:** QR code authentication, session persistence, multiple account support, real-time connection status.
- **Messaging:** Single and bulk message sending, media message support (images, videos, documents, audio), message scheduling, and advanced campaign management with options for target types (contact groups, local contacts, WhatsApp groups), scheduling (immediate, timed, odd/even hours), randomized delivery intervals, and real-time status monitoring.
- **Campaign Management:** Real-time progress tracking with visual progress bars using accurate totalTargets field, sent/remaining/failed message counts, campaign restart functionality for completed campaigns, auto-refresh for active campaigns, WebSocket integration for live updates, comprehensive campaign status management, and scrollable interface for better navigation.
- **Contact Management:** Contact group creation, CSV import, validation, deduplication, group member management, and bulk contact-to-group assignment. Contacts are sorted alphabetically by name.
- **Data Export/Import:** Export chats, contacts, and group participants as CSV; import contacts from CSV.
- **Dashboard & Analytics:** System status monitoring, campaign tracking, message statistics, real-time notifications.
- **UI/UX:** Component-based UI with shadcn/ui for a consistent and modern design. Illustrations are used for login/signup and landing pages, and lazy loading is implemented for images. Chat interface mirrors WhatsApp Web features.
- **Technical Implementations:** WebSocket connections for real-time updates, comprehensive logout functionality, robust media handling and display, secure session configuration, server-side sorting for consistent data display, real-time campaign progress broadcasting, and admin-only messaging restrictions with dynamic form controls and user permission validation.

**Database Schema:**
- **Users:** Authentication, profiles, email verification, WhatsApp number association.
- **WhatsApp Sessions:** Session persistence, login time tracking, session data storage.
- **WhatsApp Accounts:** Multiple account management, active status tracking, session data persistence.
- **Contact Groups:** Organized contact management, validation statistics, group-based messaging.
